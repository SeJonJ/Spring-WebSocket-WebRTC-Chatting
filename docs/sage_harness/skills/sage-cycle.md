# CORE skill (neutral). Project specifics come from profile, not this spec.
# CORE framework bootstrap asset: hand-shipped by `sage install`, NOT manifest-tracked.
# The manifest/claims/validate loop is reserved for project-authored skills

## intent
Run a full PDCA cycle (Phases 00–06) end to end as a single entry point: delegate
the 00–02 planning half to `/sage-plan`, then the 03–06 implementation→review→
completion half to `/sage-team`. This is a thin umbrella — it never reimplements a
gate and never re-does what the two sub-skills own; it only sequences them and
resumes at the right half.

## when_to_use
- When the user wants to run a feature or change start-to-finish in one flow
- When the user says "/sage-cycle" (Claude), "$sage-cycle" (Codex), "전체 사이클",
  "PDCA 전체", "run the whole cycle", "start to finish", or asks to develop a
  feature end to end without driving each half by hand
- Prefer the sub-skills directly for partial/resume work: `/sage-plan` for 00–02
  only, `/sage-team` to resume 03–06 on an existing plan

## procedure
1. Read `sage/project-profile.yaml` — confirm bootstrapped (`project.name`
   non-empty, `risk` and `components` set). If not → block, direct to `/sage-init`.
2. Identify the single cycle by its plan-doc stem (the feature name) under
   `paths.plan_docs`, the same way the sub-skills do. Ask for a one-sentence task
   description if not given. Match only that stem; ignore stale docs from other
   cycles (never treat another feature's plan as this cycle's).
   When this is a resumed session and the user supplies a context packet, run
   `sage context restore --snapshot <path>`, then read the generated briefing
   before resolving the half/stage. Never claim hidden conversation state was restored.
3. Planning half: check whether a real, non-empty plan doc for this cycle's stem
   exists.
   - No usable plan (absent/empty/stub) → invoke `/sage-plan` to produce the plan
     (00–02) + ownership map, then continue.
   - A real plan for this stem exists → skip planning; do NOT re-author or fork it.
   Do not make a finer completeness judgment here — defer it to the sub-skills'
   gates. `/sage-plan` owns the 00–02 gate; `/sage-team` re-validates on entry
   (refuses to run without a real plan, resume logic treats presence ≠ completion),
   so a wrong guess here cannot advance an unplanned cycle.
4. Invoke `/sage-team` to drive 03–06 (implementation → deterministic verification →
   QA → Phase-05 review via `/sage-review` → completion), honoring the same
   evidence-anchored resume logic sage-team owns.
   The sub-skills own phase-boundary `sage context snapshot` calls when
   `context_management.compaction.enabled: true`; this umbrella does not duplicate them.
5. Relay the same completion summary `/sage-team` produces: per-phase outcome,
   recorded review `run_id`, generated artifact inventory (each named by path), a summary
   of the retro proposals, verification results, and any pending human action (especially
   retro human-gate review/approval). Do not report the cycle complete on a retro note that
   is still the blank template — `sage-team`'s Done gate requires `sage retro --check` clean
   whenever a note was written (vault disabled → a recorded skip reason instead).

## advisory_scope
- role_boundary: does not implement code and does not reimplement any gate; it only
  sequences `/sage-plan` (00–02) then `/sage-team` (03–06)
- uses: sage-plan skill, sage-team skill, project-profile.yaml, AGENT_GUIDE.md
- convention_doc: AGENT_GUIDE.md
- overlay: optional `sage/asset_overrides/skills/sage-cycle.md` has project-local priority over this CORE render and is not shipped by `sage install`; it must not relax AGENT_GUIDE, phase, review, or verification gates (they stay floored by independent oracles)

## runtime_bindings
- claude: .claude/skills/sage-cycle/SKILL.md (repo — Claude Code auto-discovers)
- codex:  $CODEX_HOME/skills/sage-cycle/SKILL.md or .codex/skills/sage-cycle/SKILL.md (explicit global or project-local install scope)

## drift_checks
- conformance: procedure step 3 (delegate/skip planning by real-plan presence for
  the identified cycle stem) and step 4 (delegate 03–06 to sage-team) must be
  present; the umbrella must not reimplement planning, orchestration, or the
  sub-skills' gates itself
