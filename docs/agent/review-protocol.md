# Review protocol

L3 changes require an independent review before they are considered done.

1. The current cycle must have exactly one Phase 01, 04, and 05 document whose
   basename and single `Cycle-Stem` declaration outside fenced code blocks are identical. Ticket substrings,
   unrelated branch numbers, and recent-file/mtime fallback are not review identity.
2. An independent reviewer assesses the change. The reviewer runtime is
   resolved by `sage doctor`:
   - same-runtime clean-context via `sage review --packet-file <packet> --host <active_host>`
     (recommended local opt-out or policy off), or
   - opposite-runtime review (cross_model on + reachable). If
     `cross_model.reviewer.model` is configured, `sage cross-check` passes it explicitly
     to the peer CLI; otherwise the peer CLI default remains in effect.
   The opposite runtime is derived from the profile's single `runtime.active_host`
   (`runtime.host` only for legacy profiles), never from a shared `both` state. The same-runtime
   command must match this host and must emit process/host/model/mode/status evidence. A missing
   CLI, timeout, nonzero exit, or unparseable output is BLOCKED, not a successful fallback.
3. The review outcome is recorded in a review/plan document.

## Acceptance evidence gate

Review is not only a code-quality check. It must verify whether explicit user
requirements were converted into evidence:

1. Read the exact same-`Cycle-Stem` Phase 01 acceptance matrix outside fenced code blocks.
2. Read the exact same-`Cycle-Stem` Phase 04 acceptance evidence table outside fenced code blocks.
3. Require every matrix/evidence ID to be well formed and unique, reject Phase 04
   IDs not declared by Phase 01, and require evidence for every required Phase 01 ID.
4. Treat required items marked `FAIL` or `NOT TESTED` as blocking findings. An exact,
   active L3 waiver may defer only `NOT TESTED`; keep it unresolved in the review and
   record its reason, scope, remaining evidence, confirmer, and waiver ID. Never rewrite it as PASS.
5. Allow `N/A` only with an explicit out-of-scope/deferred/user-approved reason.
6. Do not record `Final Status: APPROVED` while required acceptance evidence is
   missing or unresolved.
7. Record exactly one anchored `Final Status: APPROVED | FAIL | BLOCKED` declaration
   outside fenced code blocks. Replace template placeholders; duplicate declarations,
   code examples, and free-text substrings are invalid.

How a change is matched to its review document is a project policy
(`profile.risk.l3_review_strategy`). Strategy candidates are preserved under
`scripts/sage_harness/hooks/strategies/`; until one is selected, L3 changes are
blocked (safe default — the gate cannot confirm a review it cannot locate).

## Adversarial review-rework loop (Loop A)

When `profile.pdca.review_loop.enabled` is true and the change is L2/L3, Phase 05 runs
as an adversarial loop instead of a single pass. The `sage-review` skill drives it; this
section is the contract it follows.

Per round (up to `review_loop.max_iterations[risk]`):

1. **FIND** — exactly one reviewer per `review_loop.lenses` over the full diff (parallel,
   divergent; do not sub-divide a lens by component/file) plus an opposite-runtime peer
   when cross-model is resolved. Findings are deduped by `(file, line-bucket, lens,
   claim-hash)` so resurfaced items don't churn.
2. **REFUTE** — exactly `review_loop.refuters` refuters run for the round; each judges ALL
   fresh findings in one batched pass (not one refuter per finding — that fanned out to
   refuters×findings subagents and re-read each file per finding). A finding survives only
   if refuting votes `< ⌈refuters/2⌉` (majority, tallied per finding — identical result).
   Refuters bias to "refuted when uncertain", so weak findings drop; a wrongly-dropped real
   issue is caught by the human BLOCKED path.
3. **TRIAGE** — surviving findings are classified `within_design` vs `architecture_change`.
   An `architecture_change` at L3 stops the loop and escalates to a human (never auto-reworked).
4. **TERMINATION** (fixed priority): no survivors → APPROVED(CONVERGED); `dry_rounds`
   consecutive empty rounds → APPROVED(DRY); iteration cap hit → BLOCKED(BUDGET_ITER);
   token budget hit → BLOCKED(BUDGET_TOK); architecture escalation → BLOCKED(BLOCKED_ARCH).
5. **REWORK + re-validate** — `within_design` survivors are reworked within the approved
   design; `verify-changes.sh` and `sage validate` must PASS before the next round.
   If rework changes acceptance coverage, update Phase 03 and Phase 04 before
   the next review pass.

Determinism boundary: the loop *body* (find/refute/rework) is judgement and runs in the
host runtime. SAGE owns the deterministic gates only — round counters, budget, termination,
and the append-only audit trail (`.sage/loop_audit.jsonl`, recorded via `sage review-loop`).
The hard backstop is unchanged: the report←approve hook blocks Phase 06 until Phase 05
records `APPROVED`. The loop never relaxes that gate; it adds audited find→refute→rework
rounds in front of it. Configuration values live only in `profile.pdca.review_loop`
(validated fail-closed by `sage doctor`/`sage validate`).

When `profile.verification.acceptance.enabled` is true, the report gate warns for L2 and
blocks for L3/unknown if Phase 04 lacks evidence or has unresolved required statuses.
Only an explicit `sage acceptance-waiver` grant for the exact L3 cycle and required ID
can turn `NOT TESTED` into a residual warning. This gate reads recorded status and audit
markers; it does not infer product quality or user identity by itself.
