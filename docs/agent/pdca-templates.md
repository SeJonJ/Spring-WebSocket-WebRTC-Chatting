# PDCA Workflow and Phase Document Templates

Use this document when a task requires Phase 00-06 planning, a vault scan, an
external consultant review, or a phase document template.

---

## Workflow Overview

| Phase | Name | Key Tasks | Deliverable |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| 00 | Base Plan | Strategy, impact analysis, prior knowledge, technical risk | `plan_docs/00-base_plan/.../[feature]_plan.md` |
| 01 | Plan | Requirements, data model, API specifications | `plan_docs/01-plan/[feature].md` |
| 02 | Design | Class/interface design, sequence diagrams, error codes | `plan_docs/02-design/[feature].md` |
| 03 | Do | Implementation, unit testing, guide checklist updates | `plan_docs/03-implementation/[feature].md` |
| 04 | Analyze | Design vs implementation gap analysis by **chatforyou-lead** (책임) + **qa-expert** (보조 — QA Coverage Verification). Single verdict not issued here. | `plan_docs/04-analyze/[feature].md` |
| 05 | Expert Review | Independent synthesis by **chatforyou-external-expert** + **host 기준 external cross-model reviewer**. Final APPROVED/FAIL/BLOCKED verdict issued here. | `plan_docs/05-expert-review/[feature].md` |
| 06 | Report | Final completion report by **chatforyou-lead**. **Written only after Phase 05 APPROVED**. If 05 = FAIL/BLOCKED → rework or recover external review → re-review → APPROVED → then 06. | `plan_docs/06-report/[feature].md` |

## Phase Separation Rules

### Mandatory Writing Rule
- Each Phase's writing obligation follows the risk level in `AGENT_GUIDE.md §3 Risk & Workflow Gate`.
- An empty `plan_docs/{phase}/` directory is **not** a convention. Treat it as a prior task's omission, not a precedent for skipping.
- Skipping a mandatory Phase requires an explicit reason in the Plan body and user approval.

### 00 vs 01 — most commonly confused boundary
| Dimension | 00 Base Plan | 01 Plan |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Nature | **CONTEXT** — why / what / impact | **CONTENT** — details of this feature itself |
| Covers | Strategy, prior knowledge (Vault scan), Backend/Frontend/Desktop impact, before/after changes, technical risk | User Stories, Data Schema/DTO, API Spec, detailed feature spec, detailed design, detailed analysis |
| Does NOT cover | Function signatures, API schemas, file/line numbers | Strategic judgment, impact analysis, Vault scan |
| Length guide | 1–2 page context | Proportional to feature scope |

### Other commonly confused boundaries
- **02 Design vs 03 Implementation**
  - 02 = architecture / sequence / error codes / interface design
  - 03 = file ownership / implementation checklist / build & test results
- **04 Analyze vs 05 Expert Review**
  - 04 = **chatforyou-lead 책임** + qa-expert 보조. 설계-구현 gap (Match Rate) + Missing Items + QA Coverage Verification. **단독 판정(APPROVED/FAIL) 금지 — 판정은 05 에서**.
  - 05 = **chatforyou-external-expert + host 기준 external cross-model reviewer**. 독립 종합 + cross-model 교차검증. 최종 판정(APPROVED/FAIL/BLOCKED) 발생 위치.
  - external/cross-model 리뷰는 **04 가 아닌 05** 에 기록.

### Signals of incorrect separation
- 00 contains a function signature → move to 01
- 00 contains a file/line number → move to 01 or 02
- 01 contains Vault prior knowledge → move to 00
- 02 contains build/test results → move to 03

## Component-level Plan Docs

The project runs **two parallel plan_docs trees**:

| Tree | Path | Purpose | Owner |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Root (feature-wide PDCA) | `plan_docs/00–06/[feature].md` | Cross-component, project-wide design under standard PDCA templates | `chatforyou-lead` |
| Backend (component-level) | `springboot-backend/plan_docs/[feature]_plan.md` | Code-level implementation design for Spring Boot side | `chatforyou-backend-expert` |
| Frontend (component-level) | `nodejs-frontend/plan_docs/[feature]_plan.md` | Code-level implementation design for Node.js frontend side | `chatforyou-frontend-expert` |
| Desktop | — | **Not used.** `chatforyou-desktop/` mirrors `nodejs-frontend/` via sync; record Desktop-affecting changes in the frontend or root tree | — |

### Writing order for L2/L3 changes
1. Root `00-base_plan/` — strategy + impact
2. Root `01-plan/` — feature-level requirements + Data Schema + API spec (cross-component contract)
3. Root `02-design/` — architecture + sequence + error codes
4. Component `springboot-backend/plan_docs/` and/or `nodejs-frontend/plan_docs/` — code-level implementation design (free format, may include code snippets, TDD plans, refactor diffs)
5. Root `03-implementation/` — file ownership table, checklist, build/test results
6. Implementation
7. Root `04-analyze/`, `05-expert-review/`, and `06-report/` — gap analysis + external review + final report

### Format conventions
- Root tree files: follow the templates below.
- Component tree files: free format. Recommended sections — Goal, Code-level Design, File-by-file Plan, Unit Test Plan, Sync/Verification Notes.
- File-naming stem must match across root and component trees for the same feature (e.g., `kurento_peer_error_fallback` in both `plan_docs/02-design/kurento_peer_error_fallback.md` and `springboot-backend/plan_docs/kurento_peer_error_fallback_plan.md`).

### Conflict resolution
- Root tree is the **single source of truth for cross-component contract** (DTO fields, event names, error codes).
- Component tree owns code-level decisions inside its own boundary; any cross-component impact must be reflected back into root `01-plan` or `02-design`.

## Phase 00 Vault Scan Procedure

Before writing the base plan, scan the Obsidian vault for prior knowledge when
`.local/local_agent_guide.md` exists and the Obsidian vault MCP tools are available.

1. Read the Obsidian vault's `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (vault-internal note, separate from the project root file).
2. Read `wiki/index.md`.
3. Search for relevant prefixed notes (filename format `TAG - {Title}.md`;
   the frontmatter `tags:` first item mirrors the category):
   - `BRAINSTORM - `
   - `SPEC - `
   - `TECH - `
   - `BUG - `
   - `POSTMORTEM - `
4. Read only the relevant notes needed for the task, normally 1-5 files.
5. Summarize findings under `## 0. Prior Knowledge (Vault Scan)` in the base plan.

When vault scan is not possible, record N/A:

```markdown
## 0. Prior Knowledge (Vault Scan)
Status: N/A
Reason: [`.local/local_agent_guide.md` not found / Obsidian MCP tools unavailable / vault path inaccessible]
Decision: Proceeding with standard workflow based on repository files only.
```

## External Consultant Protocol

External / cross-model expert review is **MANDATORY** for L3 (and recommended for L2) work. It is recorded in **Phase 05**, not 04.

1. Check whether `plan_docs/04-analyze/[feature].md` exists. If yes, read the lead's gap findings + QA coverage verification first; build on them.
2. Review from an external consultant perspective covering object-oriented design, security, and performance.
3. **Core WebRTC Architecture Gate**:
   - Before starting the review-rework loop, check whether the findings or proposed actions change WebRTC core architecture.
   - Scope: WebRTC, WebSocket, Signaling, Kurento, ICE/SDP, DataChannel, room lifecycle, media pipeline, signaling event contract, recovery/reconnect state machine.
   - If a new architecture change is detected, stop automatic rework and get user approval first.
   - Local bug fixes inside the already approved design are not blocked by this gate.
4. **External cross-model invocation**:
   - Invoke the host-specific external consult skill or CLI defined by that agent/runtime with all phase documents:
     `plan_docs/00-base_plan/[feature].md` + `01-plan/[feature].md` + `02-design/[feature].md` + `03-implementation/[feature].md` + `04-analyze/[feature].md` + component plan docs (`springboot-backend/plan_docs/`, `nodejs-frontend/plan_docs/`) + implementation files.
   - Request: "단순 코드 리뷰가 아닌 개발 맥락 기반 외부자 검토. 04의 Review Context를 포함하여 설계 의도와 구현의 일치 여부, 프로젝트 기술 스택 적합성, lifecycle/edge case/security/test/UX 리스크, 06-report 진입 가능 여부를 검토하라. 최종 권고는 APPROVED / FAIL / BLOCKED."
   - A review counts as cross-model/external only when it runs in a real separate runtime or model, such as Claude CLI from a Codex host. Same-runtime sub-agents do not count as completed cross-model review.
5. **Review-rework loop policy**:
   - L3: 3-iteration review-rework loop is mandatory and automatic in Phase 05.
   - L2: review-rework loop is recommended only. Ask the user before starting it.
   - L1/L0: do not use the Phase 05 review-rework loop.
   - One iteration means: external consult (`$claude consult` in Codex), faithful findings record, external-expert + dev-team triage, accepted rework, then `03-implementation` and `04-analyze` update.
   - Rework is limited to the already approved design and scope. New requirements, new architecture, and risky migration go to `Needs User Approval`.
6. **3-iteration stop rule**:
   - After the 3rd L3 review, if the Final Status is not `APPROVED`, record `Final Status: BLOCKED`.
   - Also record `06-report 작성 금지`, stop the workflow, and report the blocked state to the user.
7. **Fallback**:
   - Retry the host-specific consult path or start a fresh session.
   - If context is too large, retry with 04 Review Context + 01/02/03 + core implementation files.
   - If token/context limits persist, split the prompt by review lens or file group, but record the split inputs and which coverage was actually reviewed.
   - If Claude remains unavailable because of auth, quota, session-limit, token/context-limit, timeout, or runtime/tool failure, run a **separate headless Codex clean-context review** before considering same-session fallback. This is not cross-model review, but it is stronger than same-session sub-agent review because it starts an independent non-interactive Codex session.
     - Example: `CODEX_HOME=$PWD/.codex codex exec --cd "$PWD" --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval never "Review Phase 05 inputs as an independent clean-context reviewer. Do not edit files. Return P0/P1/P2 findings and APPROVED/FAIL/BLOCKED recommendation."`
     - Record it as `Reviewer: Codex headless separate session (clean-context fallback) — Claude unavailable because [reason]`.
     - Record the reason explicitly, for example: `Claude unavailable: token/context limit. Used separate headless Codex review instead.`
   - Symmetrically — relevant when the host is Claude and Codex is the intended cross-model reviewer, as in ChatForYou's `chatforyou-external-expert` → `/codex consult` path — if Codex remains unavailable because of auth, quota, session-limit, token/context-limit, timeout, or runtime/tool failure, run a **separate headless Claude clean-context review** before considering same-session fallback. Do not silently fall through to a same-session `chatforyou-*` sub-agent review and record it as if it were cross-model.
     - Example: `claude -p "Review Phase 05 inputs as an independent clean-context reviewer. Do not edit files. Return P0/P1/P2 findings and APPROVED/FAIL/BLOCKED recommendation." --permission-mode plan`
     - Record it as `Reviewer: Claude headless separate session (clean-context fallback) — Codex unavailable because [reason]`.
     - Record the reason explicitly, for example: `Codex unavailable: auth/token expired. Used separate headless Claude review instead.`
   - Emit a copy-pastable host-specific consult command or raw CLI prompt for the user to run.
   - Ingest the user's run output into the 05 doc.
   - Record auth, quota, rate-limit, session-limit, token/context-limit, timeout, and tool/runtime failures under `Degraded Evidence` in Phase 05 with the original symptom and timestamp.
8. Identify the reviewer clearly: `Reviewer: [cross-model tool] via [host agent]`.
9. Record the opinion under `## External / Cross-model Review` in the **Phase 05** document. Output must be **faithful (no summarization)**.
10. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — final verdict is external-expert + user.
11. If mandatory L3 external review cannot be completed after fallback, the **Separate Headless Codex Clean-context Review**, the **Separate Headless Claude Clean-context Review**, and/or the **Intra-model Adversarial Review Loop** (see below) are the only sanctioned substitutes. They are not equivalent to cross-model review. Without either a completed cross-model review or a completed degraded substitute with user sign-off, record `Final Status: BLOCKED` in 05 and do not write 06.
12. Propose improvements. Obtain user approval before adding new scope, architecture changes, or risky migration.

### Separate Headless Codex Clean-context Review (cross-model UNAVAILABLE only)

Use this when Claude cannot complete the review because of auth, quota, session-limit, token/context-limit, timeout, or runtime/tool failure. This path must launch a new non-interactive Codex process; it must not use a same-session sub-agent.

Minimum command shape:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=$PWD/.codex codex exec --cd "$PWD" --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval never "<review prompt>"
```

Rules:
- The prompt must include only phase documents, Review Context, implementation files, and explicit review questions. Do not include the author's defense or the current session's reasoning.
- The reviewer must return P0/P1/P2 findings, file/line evidence where possible, and a recommendation.
- Record in Phase 05: `Reviewer: Codex headless separate session (clean-context fallback) — Claude unavailable because [auth/quota/session-limit/token-context-limit/timeout/tool error]`.
- Record the Claude failure under `Degraded Evidence`, then record the Codex headless output faithfully.
- Final Status is at best **`APPROVED_WITH_RISK`**, with the explicit risk: "independent cross-model verification not performed; substituted with separate headless Codex clean-context review." This requires **explicit user sign-off recorded in 05** before writing 06.

### Separate Headless Claude Clean-context Review (cross-model UNAVAILABLE only)

Use this when Codex cannot complete the review because of auth, quota, session-limit, token/context-limit, timeout, or runtime/tool failure — the direction relevant whenever the host itself is Claude and Codex is the intended cross-model reviewer (e.g. `chatforyou-external-expert` → `/codex consult`). This path must launch a new non-interactive Claude process; it must not use a same-session sub-agent.

Minimum command shape:

```bash
claude -p "<review prompt>" --permission-mode plan
```

Rules:
- The prompt must include only phase documents, Review Context, implementation files, and explicit review questions. Do not include the author's defense or the current session's reasoning.
- The reviewer must return P0/P1/P2 findings, file/line evidence where possible, and a recommendation.
- Record in Phase 05: `Reviewer: Claude headless separate session (clean-context fallback) — Codex unavailable because [auth/quota/session-limit/token-context-limit/timeout/tool error]`.
- Record the Codex failure under `Degraded Evidence`, then record the Claude headless output faithfully.
- Final Status is at best **`APPROVED_WITH_RISK`**, with the explicit risk: "independent cross-model verification not performed; substituted with separate headless Claude clean-context review." This requires **explicit user sign-off recorded in 05** before writing 06.

### Intra-model Adversarial Review Loop (cross-model UNAVAILABLE only)

Use this **only** when the host cross-model consult path is unavailable and the fallback retries in step 7 have failed. It is a **degraded substitute, not an equivalent** — a single model shares its own blind spots (see the 2026-06 heartbeat P0 case in `docs/agent/webrtc-review-protocol.md`). It therefore can only yield `APPROVED_WITH_RISK`, never a clean `APPROVED`.

Procedure (3–5 iterations):
1. **Critical review**: invoke `chatforyou-external-expert` (or `external-consultant`) in a **fresh context**. Provide only the phase documents + implementation files — never the author's justification. Each round must use a different adversarial lens so rounds do not echo each other: R1 flow correctness · R2 failure/lifecycle · R3 security/auth · R4 ops/config/deadlock · R5 regression/edge. Output strictly in the `P0/P1/P2 + Decision` format of `docs/agent/webrtc-review-protocol.md`. No summarization.
2. **Feedback validity verification**: a separate pass (different agent or the lead) checks each finding — is it real, does it cite `file:line` evidence, is the severity correct? The `cross-model-p0-no-downgrade` rule is enforced here: a principle-level P0 must NOT be downgraded because the component is "core" — to lower severity requires code/domain evidence AND recorded user sign-off.
3. **Apply to code**: accepted findings → rework within the already approved scope. New scope/architecture/risky migration → `Needs User Approval`.
4. **Stop**: when a round produces no new P0/P1, or at 5 iterations max (3-iteration stop rule of step 6 still applies for declaring no-progress).

Recording in Phase 05:
- `Reviewer: chatforyou-external-expert (intra-model adversarial loop) — cross-model UNAVAILABLE`. Record every round faithfully (no summarization).
- Final Status is at best **`APPROVED_WITH_RISK`**, with the explicit risk recorded: "independent cross-model verification not performed; substituted with N-round intra-model adversarial review." This requires **explicit user sign-off recorded in 05** before writing 06. Re-run a real cross-model review once the path is restored.
