# sage-cycle — SAGE full PDCA cycle (Phases 00–06)

Invoke as `/sage-cycle` (Codex) or `$sage-cycle` (Codex).

Do not edit this CORE render directly (the write-guard blocks it and `sage install --force` overwrites it). For project-local customization use `/sage-asset-override`: SAGE materializes an eligible overlay into this render as a managed block and `sage validate` gates it. Overlays for gate-bearing assets without an independent oracle are not yet supported (validate reports them).

This is the **umbrella** entry point for a whole PDCA cycle. It runs the two halves
in order:

- **`/sage-plan`** — Phases 00–02: plan docs + file-ownership map.
- **`/sage-team`** — Phases 03–06: implementation → deterministic verification →
  QA → Phase-05 review (via `/sage-review`) → completion.

sage-cycle is deliberately **thin**: it sequences the two sub-skills and resumes at
the correct half. It never reimplements a gate and never re-authors a plan or
re-drives orchestration — those belong to `/sage-plan` and `/sage-team`. SAGE still
owns every deterministic gate (`pre-implementation-gate`, `verify-changes`,
`sage review-loop` audit, the 06←05 report←approve backstop).

> Prefer the sub-skills directly for partial or resume work: `/sage-plan` when you
> only need the plan, `/sage-team` to resume 03–06 on an existing plan. Use
> `/sage-cycle` when you want the whole thing driven from one call.

## Read these first (mandatory, in order)

1. `docs/sage_harness/skills/sage-cycle.md` — authoritative spec: procedure, drift_checks
2. `AGENT_GUIDE.md` — PDCA phases, risk gate, phase-first rule
3. `sage/project-profile.yaml` — `project.name`, `components`, `paths.plan_docs`

## Gate check (do this before anything else)

Confirm the profile is bootstrapped (`project.name` non-empty, `risk`/`components`
set). If not → stop: "Profile is not bootstrapped. Run `/sage-init` first."

## Step 1 — Identify the cycle

Establish the single cycle this run is about, the same way the sub-skills do — by
its plan-doc stem (the feature name) under `paths.plan_docs`. If the user has not
named the task, ask for a one-sentence description and derive/confirm the stem.
Match only that stem; ignore stale docs from other cycles (never treat another
feature's plan as this cycle's).

## Step 2 — Planning half (00–02)

Check whether a **real, non-empty** plan doc for *this* cycle's stem already exists.

- **No usable plan for this stem** (absent, empty, or only a stub) → invoke
  **`/sage-plan`** (`$sage-plan` on Codex). It runs the gate check, scopes the task **via
  the planning interview** (`docs/agent/plan-interview.md` — elicits requirements/design
  before writing 00/01), invokes the leader to author the plan (00–02), and hands back an
  ownership map.
- **A real plan for this stem exists** → skip planning. Do NOT re-author or duplicate
  it (that would fork the cycle). Go straight to Step 3.

Do not make a finer completeness judgment here — that is the sub-skills' job, and
this umbrella must not reimplement their gates. `/sage-plan` owns the 00–02 gate, and
`/sage-team` re-validates on entry: it refuses to run without a real plan and its
resume logic treats **presence ≠ completion**. So even a wrong guess here cannot
advance an unplanned cycle — sage-team is the deterministic backstop.

## Step 3 — Implementation half (03–06)

Invoke **`/sage-team`** (`$sage-team` on Codex). It takes the plan + ownership map
and drives the cycle to completion using its own evidence-anchored resume logic
(**presence ≠ completion**): implementation (03) → deterministic verification →
QA (04) → Phase-05 review via `/sage-review` → completion (06). Do not duplicate any
of sage-team's steps here — this umbrella only invokes it.

- **Codex host**: sage-team spawns implementers as parallel subagents.
- **Codex host**: sage-team sequentializes the same steps (semantics preserved).

## Step 4 — Report

Relay the same completion summary `/sage-team` reports: per-phase outcome, recorded
review `run_id`, generated artifact inventory (name each artifact by path), a summary of
the retro proposals (pattern → target → proposed change), verification results, and any
pending human action (especially retro human-gate review/approval). If the cycle stopped
early (gate block, BLOCKED review, red verification), report where it stopped and what is
required to continue — do not claim the cycle completed.

## Done

The cycle is complete when `/sage-team` reports 06 written against an APPROVED
Phase 05 with a clean, closed loop-audit run and both closing captures accounted for:
a completed (or explicitly recorded skipped/failed) knowledge write-back, and retro
run with its note — when the vault wrote one — filled and passing `sage retro --check`
(or a recorded skip reason, including "vault disabled"). A retro note left as the blank
template does not count as retro having run. sage-cycle adds no completion criterion of
its own beyond sequencing the two halves.
